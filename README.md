# Toward-Sparse-HPE
This project aims to make head pose estimation without face detection in sparse dataset and robust to occlusion..

## Description
Our Head Pose Esitmation (HPE) achieves proper performance and robustness in sparse and masked dataset without using face detection. The details of our project are summarized as follows: 
1. Sparse model architecture based on Retina-Face.
2. Newly generated masked data only for HPE.
3. Trained model with diverse dataset
4. Newly generated rotated dataset in range -45 degree to 45 degree. 
Note that due to uploading constraint in Github, we are not able to upload all dataset. If has any concerns about dataset, please email me.
