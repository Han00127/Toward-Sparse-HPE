# Toward-Sparse-HPE
This project aims to make head pose estimation without face detection in sparse dataset and robust to occlusion..

## Description
Our Head Pose Esitmation (HPE) achieves proper performance and robustness in sparse and masked dataset without using face detection. The details of our project are summarized as follows: 
1. Sparse model architecture based on Retina-Face.
2. Newly generated masked data only for HPE.
3. Trained model with diverse dataset
4. Newly generated rotated dataset in range -45 degree to 45 degree. 


## Notification
We are not able to upload all dataset and final presentation file due to uploading constraint in Github. We upload the pdf version presentation files, it can be found in /presentation/final_ppt.pdf.
If you have any concerns about dataset and presentation files, please email me.
